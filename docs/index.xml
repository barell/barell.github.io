      <description>Own scripts, Wordpress, Jekyll&amp;hellip; Hugo! I had this idea of having my own blog for many years. I always wanted to write about programming - something I do everyday for many years now.
My first attempt was to create a blog using PHP/HTML/CSS/JS from scratch. But I quickly realised this is a lot of work. I wanted my blog to be responsive and easy to maintain.
My second attempt was installing Wordpress on some basic hosting platform with custom domain.</description>
